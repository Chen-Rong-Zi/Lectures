   One of my favorite quotes comes from A-S. He said, For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin real life.
  But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid.
  Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life. This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness.
 Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment that you have.
