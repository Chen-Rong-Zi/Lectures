    I had been a social person in high school and I expected to make greet friends right away when I got to colleague.
But the fact was on the other side of my expectation. I was disappointed, so I decided to pour the sense of my loneliness into 
a 4-and-a-half-minute video, and posted on my social media account.
    It had became a hit, which proved that a lot of ones had experience the same as mine. Studying in colleague and being a fresh 
man isn't a easy deal, or rather, an unexpected experience with impact on everything in one's life: how to get used to local climate
, starting a totally new education, dealing with living along without caring from families. It seems more than a joke to have a 
close friendship that takes years to build.
    My social life had became a big game of trials and errors, slowly, I got to know where I would feel welcome and included in some
groups.
