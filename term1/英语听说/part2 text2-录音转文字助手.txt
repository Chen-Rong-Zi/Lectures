 You will hear a man making enquiries about buying a mobile phone.

Good afternoon. Hello. I'm looking for a mobile phone. OK. Well, you've come to the right place.
Did you want any particular model? Well, it's a birthday present for my son, George.
OK. And how old is he? George? He's 13 next week.
Ah, a teenager. Is this his first phone? Yes. We want to be able to contact him when he's out.
And he wants to chat with his friends. Well, this phone is very good for texting, you know, sending SMS messages.
It's got predictive text and all that. That's what all the teenagers want. They're text mad.
Really? Is it expensive to send a text? Not as much as making calls.
On this particular network, it only costs 10 cents. 10 cents? That's pretty cheap.
Yeah. Some networks are even cheaper. Such as? Let me see. At the moment, the cheapest network is ABC.
ABC? Yeah. But as with all networks, it depends what time you use it.
Oh, really? On this network, the most expensive time is morning. But if you call in the evenings, you can save the most.
OK. I'll tell him that. By the way, how does he pay for the calls? Two ways. Contract, but he'd need a bank account for that.
For teenagers, it's best to have pay as you go. This way, you pay in advance for all your calls, and you never get any nasty bills.
You just have to buy a top-up card now and again. Where can you buy those? Top-up cards? Most newsagents and supermarkets sell them these days.
Good. What about abroad? Sorry? My son is going abroad on a school trip.
They're going on a Mediterranean cruise, and they'll be stopping at lots of different countries.
Can he use it in Europe? Sure. He can use it and buy top-up cards in 120 countries worldwide.
Fantastic. One last thing. We often go cycling in the mountains. What's the coverage like?
It depends. This network is quite good. They say it covers 87% of the country, which isn't bad.
OK. I'll take it. Fine. Now, will you be needing a hands-free kit?
A what? A hands-free kit. It allows you to use the phone without using your hands.
Basically, if he does a lot of cycling, it's much safer to be in control of your bicycle.
This way, he can make calls and still be in control. It's much safer. OK. I'll have that too.
Now, how much is it? It's about $10.
OK. I'll have that. OK.
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
