 Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort.
 Temples and statuses decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their authors' minds ages ago. What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed pages.
 The only effective time has been to sift out the bad products, for nothing in literature can long survive but what is really good.
