1. Reducing Social Pressure:

Enhancing Expression Freedom:
    Compared to making a phone call, leaving a message allows individuals to express themselves more freely. 
    Making a call might induce nervousness or discomfort for some people. 
    Through messaging, individuals can articulate their thoughts more comfortably without the pressure of immediate face-to-face interaction. 
    This is particularly crucial for those who are introverted or not adept at in-person communication.

Personalized Expression:
    Messaging also permits individuals to showcase their personality and style through writing, choosing suitable wording and tone to convey information. 
    This contributes to establishing a more personalized and relaxed communication atmosphere, something that is often challenging to achieve through phone conversations.

2. Long-Term Storage:

Facilitating Review and Retrieval:
    Messages can be saved, archived, and easily retrieved when needed. 
    In contrast, phone calls are transient and challenging to document. 
    Through messaging, communication content can be recorded, facilitating both parties to review and cross-check information at any time. 
    This is particularly practical for aspects of work such as project collaboration and task assignment.

Legal and Compliance Requirements:
    In certain industries, maintaining records of communication is crucial for meeting legal and compliance requirements. 
    Through messaging, organizations can better track, manage, and retain business-related information, preparing for potential legal liabilities and compliance challenges.

3. Providing Thinking Time:

Avoiding Misunderstandings and Impulsive Remarks:
    Messaging provides participants with more time for thoughtful consideration, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or impulsive remarks due to haste. 
    This helps establish more in-depth and clear communication, especially when dealing with important decisions or sensitive topics.

Fostering In-Depth Discussions:
    The written form of messaging encourages more profound and organized communication, as participants can carefully formulate and expand upon their points. 
    Such in-depth discussions ensure comprehensive and accurate communication.

4. Politeness in Written Communication:

Establishing a Professional Image:
    In a business environment, written communication is often perceived as more formal and professional. 
    Through messaging, individuals can better construct their professional image, conveying an attitude of attention to detail and careful expression.

Facilitating Communication Standards:
    Written communication aids in establishing and adhering to communication standards, ensuring the consistency and clarity of information delivery. 
    This is crucial for standardized requirements in team collaboration and project management, especially in large organizations or multinational companies.

5. Collaborating Across Time Zones:

Facilitating Remote Work:
    Messaging serves as an ideal communication method for remote work, enabling team members to view and respond to messages based on their individual schedules. 
    This flexibility promotes collaboration in cross-regional teams during the globalization era, enhancing team adaptability and efficiency.

Avoiding Collaboration Wait Times:
    In teams spanning multiple time zones, phone calls often require coordinating schedules, while messaging can reduce time wasted waiting for the other party. 
    This real-time and flexible communication approach makes collaboration smoother and more efficient.
